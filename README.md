## Folder Structure

I used clean architecture for implementation:

lib
    - core : for shared utils files
    - features
        - data : local data source and movie models, for generating dummy movie data
        - presentation : normal UI pages and widgets

## Used Libraries and Packages 

1. carousel_slider: ^4.2.1 - for smooth slider 
2. skeletons: ^0.0.3 - for widget placeholder
